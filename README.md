# Seasonality and Weather Impacts on Health Conditions
Exploring how weather impacts user-reported symptoms from the Flaredown app. Weather is recorded automatically at the time of reporting,
so geographical location and weather condition factors can be examined in addition to self-reported triggers.

**Possible Questions:**<br>
• Are there subsets of condition types and effects that are differently affected by weather and time?

• Is it possible to reliably predict flare triggers for a given user or condition?

• Could we develop a way to recommend treatments more effectively based on the similarity of users or forecasted conditions?

• Can we predict flares of conditions based on weather or a user’s symptoms and triggers?
