# Seasonality and Weather Impacts on Health Conditions

## Project Description: 
This project explores how weather impacts user-reported symptoms from the Flaredown app. Weather conditions were recorded automatically at the time of trigger reporting, allowing geographical location and weather condition factors to be examined along with self-reported triggers.

## Data:
**[Chronic Condition Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/flaredown/flaredown-autoimmune-symptom-tracker)**

## Report/Visualizations:
**[Tableau Story](https://public.tableau.com/shared/Y3Q355QZX?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)**

## Key Questions:
- Are there subsets of condition types and effects that are differently affected by weather and time?
- Is it possible to reliably predict flare triggers for a given user or condition?
- Could we develop a way to recommend treatments more effectively based on the similarity of users or forecasted conditions?
- Can we predict flares of conditions based on weather or a userâ€™s symptoms and triggers?
