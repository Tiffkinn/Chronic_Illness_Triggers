# Seasonality and Weather Impacts on Health Conditions
Exploring how weather impacts user-reported symptoms from the Flaredown app. Weather is recorded automatically at the time of reporting,
so geographical location and weather condition factors can be examined in addition to self reported triggers.

**Possible Questions**
• Are there subsets of condition types and effects that are differently affected by weather and time?
• Is it possible to reliably predict flare triggers for a given user or condition?
• Could we develop a way to recommend treatments more effectively based on the similarity of users or forecasted conditions?
• Can we predict flares of conditions based on weather or a user’s symptoms and triggers?
